# 👋 Hi, I'm Harish  

## 🚀 About Me  
I am currently building **AI-driven Agentic tools** that solve critical business challenges and **automate enterprise workflows**. My journey into AI began with a deep fascination for **LLMs and their inner workings**, which led me to explore and master them. Since then, **teaching machines to learn** has become my passion. I started with Traditional Machine Learning, gradually transitioning into **Deep Learning with a specialization in NLP**. I have further strengthened my expertise through the rigorous coursework at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, completing:  
- **CS 7641:** Machine Learning  
- **CS 7643:** Deep Learning  

Now, I focus on **developing intelligent AI systems** leveraging **LLMs, RAG, and automation** to drive real-world impact. My most challenging work projects include:  
- **Developing an end-to-end AI agent** that automates the translation of **I18N keys** into **20 languages** using **LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
- **Building an AI chatbot** to **automate test case generation**, identify **use-case dependencies**, and retrieve relevant test cases using **similarity search with ChromaDB**. Additionally, the chatbot provides **instant insights** about the product by answering user queries.
